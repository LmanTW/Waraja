# Waraja - What the Japanese!?

Waraja is a flexible quizing APP for learning Japanese (or actually, any other topics). Waraja shouldn’t be used solely as a rote memorization tool, but as a starting point for learning. Begin with Waraja, then apply what you’ve learned in real-world situations. Challenges should be designed not only to provide basic questions and answers, but also to offer historical context and the reasoning behind each topic.
